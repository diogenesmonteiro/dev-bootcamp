Examples will include how individuals experience and respond to policing, examining the effects of immigration and border security policies, and tracing how people and groups mobilize to challenges laws perceived as unjust. '), ('People and Animals in the Past', 'This course asks students to consider the human as a special kind of animal, and the roles of other animals in our human worlds: as companions, spirits, artistic muses, laborers, and as sources of food, clothing, shelter, and tools. We examine how human-animal relationships have changed over time, and consider human impacts upon animals and environments at multiple scales: from continental and island colonizations, to local extirpations and global extinctions. While our scope is both geographically and temporally broad, specific case studies will be highlighted from Africa, Eurasia, North America, and the Pacific islands.'), ('Neurosciences 1', 'Understanding the normal functioning of the peripheral and central nervous systems and how they are affected by disease. • Developing skills of analysing normal and abnormal movement allowing students to clinically reason. • The tools needed to assess the patient with a neurological impairment to identify an effective management plan.'), ('Cardiorespiratory 1', 'Module	Credits	Compulsory/optional Foundations for Physiotherapy Practice	30 Credits	Compulsory Cardiorespiratory 1	15 Credits	Compulsory The student will learn about the normal f unction of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and how they are affected by disease.
